# Sliding-mode-based-DC-motor-speed-control.
This my master's degree graduation thesis, it's about DC motor speed control using the sliding mode method, the motor it's controlled based on three models which are cascade and reduced, and complete model. the method has proved that it's robust against dc motor parameters changing and able to track a reference speed.
